# to-do-list

A Todo list app designed to meet the requirements provided by The Odin Project. A to do must be created as objects using classes or factory functions. At a minimum, a to do must contain a title, description, due date and priority. Additionally, to dos may include notes and a checklist.

## Introduction
This is the final project in this section of the JavaScript section titled Organizing Your JavaScript Code. This has been a remarkably informative section. As a 'self-taught' developer for nearly 20 years, I've been doing so many things the hard way simply because I didn't know any better. I look forward to tackling this project and continuing to learn how to be a better developer! 

## Skill
- Webpack
- npm
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

## Tools
- VSCode
- Git / GitHub

## Resources
- [Webpack tutorial and configuration](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#using-a-configuration)


## To do 
- [ ] Create to do objects with factory functions or classes. Add required properties.
- [ ] Add functionality to separate to dos into multiple projects
- [ ] Separate application logic from DOM interaction (MVC pattern)
- [ ] UI Design objectives: A user must be able to 1. View all projects. 2. View all to dos in each project. 3. Expand a single to do to see / edit it's details. 4. Delete a to do. 
- [ ] Consider using date-fns for manipulating dates and times
- [ ] Publish to GitHub - will require additional config since it's looking for index.html but webpack is setup to use dist/index.html
